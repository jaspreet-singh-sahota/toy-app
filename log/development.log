Try to create a micropost with empty content and no user id. 3. Try to create a micropost with over 140 characters of content (say, the first paragraph from the Wikipedia article on Ruby). 4. Destroy the microposts from the previous exercises. 2.3.2 Putting the micro in microposts Any micropost worthy of the name should have some means of enforcing the length of the post. Implementing this constraint in Rails is easy with valida- tions; to accept microposts with at most 140 characters (à la the original design of Twitter), we use a length validation. At this point, you should open the file app/models/micropost.rb in your text editor or IDE and fill it with the \t1 \tShow \tEdit \tDestroy\r\n", "user_id"=>""}, "commit"=>"Create Micropost"}
